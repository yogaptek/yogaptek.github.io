Authorization, and Accounting) A computer mechanism which regulates performance of internet devices. For instance, router is one of  devices which allows users to connect to the internet. It is used  to spread the internet connection to the computer. The Internet connection speed can be arranged by either the government or internet/telecommunication providers. These institutions can directly regulate the internet connection speed depending on the necessity.\nAccess Control+A program in the operating system which can limit computer activity or access. This security feature is implemented by the computer users to secure data and avoid damage if the computer is used by other users. The system only allows those who have accecss from the owner of the computer.\nAccount Harvesting+It is a computer program which requires connection to the internet. The program can send e-mail to certain accounts randomly. The message sent is in the forms of advertisements or other commercials. The program does not only send messages, but also track position and collect e-mail addresses of the 'potential targets'.\nAdvocacy+A solution to several problems to protect human rights due to  a decent living. Implementation of this policy is recognized as a proper effort to protect intellectual property rights for works, particularly in the field of information technology.\nAfriNIC (African Network Information Center)+Internet network management center located in the African continent which provides a service of area code searching for computers connected to the internet network. The operational bases are managed by several countries in Africa which are centered in Mauritius. This program is designed to track computers and users that have allegedly committed abuse.\nAmplifier+\tTraffic connection or internet speed can be controlled by hackers. The hackers absorb the amount of internet speed of internet users. The users may not realize that other parties can take advantage. However, this condition can make the internet users to purchase additional costs.\nAnonymous+Hackers send messages to the particular computers to hack the computers. The messages do not include the name or identity of the senders so that it is called anonymous. There is another terminology such as when computer users access e-mail or websites without registering as a guest. This terminology is not recommended due to the limited information and access which may be received.\nARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers)+\tNon-profit organization which is built to regulate or record internet protocol numbers in North America and some parts of the Caribbean Islands. The organization has its function to allocate power or speed of internet connection and facilitate updating content regarding positive information and education.\nARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)+Research center of the United States is in collaboration with related universities to support the  research development for educational institutions. It was established to develop network technology advancements due to a positive impact.\nATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)+\tFurther planning regarding to development of sophisticated communication devices. The devices are invented or made to accommodate all the latest communication hardwares due to provide wide internet connection without limit.\nBackbone+Control center or communication network base includes telephone and internet offices. The base is controlled by the government and cannot be regulated indivudually. In addition, the system implemented can accommodate scientific research based on establishment in  information technology.\nBackdoor+\tCharacteristics of the spread of Trojan horse viruses. The viruses can attack computers which are connected to the internet by infiltrating to data on the computers. The computers' security system hardly detect the virus leading to system failure. After  declined performance and system damage found in the computers, hackers will be able to access data in the computers and control the computers remotely.\nBeautiful Blondes+Hacking activities are not only performed by men but also women. Around 1980's a group consisted four female hackers from Europe had raised attention of the world by their expertise in adapting monikers. Moniker is a hacking effort which can only done by skillful hackers.\nBIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon)+An internet program which provides services for searching the domain name system (DNS) as well as the area code for computers connected to the internet.  The DNS is a numeric code as well as a telephone numbers providing access to identify the location of the computers. \nBlack Hats+\tGroups of hackers who carry out hacking activities with various motivations, including revenge, sabotage, theft, or showing off. These may be considered unpleasant actions by the computer users leading to moral and material losses. The hackers who are members of the black hat community are often called crackers.\nBluejackers+Data transfer can be carried out via a computer or smart phone feature without using a cable namely Bluetooth. Only small data can be sent to another electronic device because it takes more time to finish the process. A person who is using a computer or mobile phone to send or receive data via Bluetooth is called a bluejacker. Terminology of bluejacker was originally derived from hacking activities via the bluetooth feature using a smart phone.\nBS7799 (British Standard 7799)+A system that ensures security for those who have business in the banking sector. Developments of information technology have raising concerns from the threats of hackers. Therefore, the United Kingdom empowers relevant experts to further enhance security and trust in the business. The 7799 is an information security management practice code and specifications for an information and security management system. The two units were specifically developed to avoid the practice of banking exploitations by hackers.\nBUGTRAQ+Features in electronic messages can protect the computers from virus attacks and hacking activities. The e-mail service companies work and computer antivirus companies have agreement to provide security services for the account owners.\nC64 (Commodore)+Computers was interestingly developed in 1981. The computers certainly has extraordinary performance so that the hackers  could use the computers for hacking activities. The hackers could only hack small information in accordance with computer ability. In that period, the monitors were still in the development process so televisions were used as the monitors.\nCAPTCHA+(Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) It is a registration test which is provided for running computer programs or accessing social media. This feature was developed to ensure that the computers are being used by humans, not robots or animals.
